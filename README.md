This project focuses on using neural networks, specifically the U-NET architecture, for the automatic delineation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) to enhance cardiac diagnosis. Traditional ECG interpretation can be error-prone and complex, especially with anomalous signals. By adapting U-NET, commonly used for image segmentation, this work demonstrates its potential in accurately identifying ECG features such as P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves, surpassing conventional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms in generalization capability. The model was pre-trained with synthetic ECG data, achieving promising results with a U-NET architecture optimized with a bidirectional LSTM block, outperforming previous methods in key metrics. This innovative approach shows significant promise in clinical applications and opens new avenues for research in automated ECG analysis using artificial intelligence.
